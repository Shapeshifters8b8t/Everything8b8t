# Log dupe
Look straight down, open your inventory, drop the item you want to dupe, and craft planks. Requires 64 or over of logs.
# Stick dupe
Look straight down, open your inventory, drop the item you want to dupe, and spam the stick option in the crafting menu. Requires 64 or over of planks.
# Button dupe
(Invented by AcaiBerii) Similar to the log dupe, but you use planks instead of logs. Output only good for redstone and cannot be reused like the log dupe.

# Conserving resources
For my dupes, I prefer using the log dupe to make planks, and then using the stick dupe to dupe after that.
